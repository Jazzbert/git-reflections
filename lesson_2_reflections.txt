What happens when you initialize a repository?  Why do you need to do it?

	It looks like git creates the hidden directory and creates the basic meta data
needed to track the versioning of the files in the directory.  Without the
initial metadata, there would be no reference for the other commands to work
from to execute.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository?  What value do you think it offers?

	You can put files in the working directory that will not be part of
the repository or aren't ready to be put into the pository in a given commit.
The staging area allows you to put just the files that pertain the next commit
in one "place", separating from every other file in the working directory.
